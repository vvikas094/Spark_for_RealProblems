##Derived statistics on large Twitter and Google datasets using Spark and Python.

1) What hour of the day does a user, &#064PrezOno tweet the most on average, using every day we have twitter data?  Include a plot of the expected number of tweets for each hour of the day, for those he did tweet.  For example if Ono tweeted once every day at 12:30PM, his expected number of tweets between 12 and 1 would be 1.  If he alternates between 2 and 3 tweets per day, his average would be 2.5.(Twitter)
